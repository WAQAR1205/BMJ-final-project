        <p>
          If you want to became a doctor and engineer then we opt science stream. Becoming a doctor and
          engineer (from highly reputed college) is not an easy task. Every year around 15 lakhs student
          apply for an entrance exam and only 2–5% students achieve there dreams. If we want to achieve it
          we must have to start preparation as early as possible and makes our base strong I.e 2 years of
          learning in subjects from 10th. It's not only for Science students it's apply for all stream students.
          <br> <br>

          Class 12th marks are also important for admission in top colleges. After completing yours
          studies when you go for a job then yours 12th marks also shown in yours Resume. In all entrance
          exams after 10th class 12th marks act as minimum qualifying marks. If yours marks below it you
          are not eligible for the respective examination. Class 11th and 12th these two years of studies
          are the deciding years of your career.
